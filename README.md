1.Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

In 1983, The Network Control Program used by ARPANET was replaced with the TCP/IP protocol, which became the most widely used network protocol in the world. A survey showed that 1.4% of U.S. adults had a home computer and used the Internet.
In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML and established the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol client and a server via the Internet. The use of the Internet exploded after 1990.
In 1995 The NSF ceased funding the Internet, making it a completely self-sustaining industry.
The first social media site was created in 1997 and in 1999, the first blogging sites became popular, creating a social media sensation.
The dot-com bubble from 1995 to 2000, was a period of extreme growth followed by the dot-com crash, from 2000 to 2002 when many online shopping companies failed and shut down.

2.Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domains are identified using a domain name and are assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS). Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. Within the url www.ruthmcilwaine.co/index.html the domain is ruthmcilwaine.co.
Domain Name System (DNS) helps convert domain names into an Internet Protocol (IP) address that computers use to identify each other on the network.  DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
A web browser is an application used to access and view websites which interacts through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Common web browsers include Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.
Web servers are what supply the content for web browsers; what the browser requests, the server delivers through Internet network connections. 

3.Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet-switching network and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. The ARPANET was initially funded by the United States Department of Defense. It’s researchers developed many of the protocols used for Internet communication today.
The initial ARPANET consisted of four IMPs and was first established in 1969. Because of its government funding, a 1982 handbook was published stating that emails being sent for commercial profit or political purposes is both anti-social and illegal. The ARPANET was officially decommissioned in 1990. In 1995 The NSF ceased funding the Internet, making it a completely self-sustaining industry.
In 2014, global Internet traffic reached 16,144GBps and today global fixed broadband speeds will reach 42.5 Mbps.
