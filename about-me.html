<h1><br />- About Me -</h1>
    <p><br />Hi, my name is Ruth. I’m a junior full stack developer living in Melbourne. 
    Over the last few years, I have spent my time at home raising my three kids and always looking for my next project to keep me busy. When my kids were all at school, I thought it would be the perfect time for me to return to work and to do something that I can be passionate about. I am excited about learning and love any opportunity to work and develop my skills.
    I love being creative. For me, that can be decorating cakes for my family or friends. Or working on my kids’s school website, which is what started me on the path of web development.
    I achieved my open water diving certificate last year. I have been diving irregularly through out my life and love being in the water and scuba diving. Now that I have the certificate, I’ve a list of locations that I’m excited to go dive at.
